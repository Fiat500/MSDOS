All heavenly gods, humans, and asuras in the entire Universe believe that the present Shakyamuni Buddha, who left the palace of Shakya not far from the city of Gaya, attained Supreme Perfect Enlightenment at the sanctuary of the Way. O virtuous men! In truth, however, it has been immeasurably boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayuta kalpas since I became a Buddha. (Lotus Sutra 16: 1.3)
